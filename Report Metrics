During the time working as a Data Analyst at SNB, I mainly researched and built reports based on the requirements from Retail Director and Managers in order to get the insights from the raw data exported from a management system called HTSoft, and the files are exported and updated daily in XLSX format.
Below is the metrics that I and my coworker have together built and run successfully in PowerBI DAX and calculated columns:

With PowerBI, we have managed the source files on SharePoint (Cloud Platform of Microsoft) in order to keep the data integrity and updated regularly.
